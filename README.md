# skisim
Ski simulation for investigating accident situations, suitable for experts and specialists.


This is a prototype for a new ski simulation. 
You can move the skiers using the keyboard (+ -, arrow keys, ö ä, Tab) or with the mouse (select and move with the left mouse button, right-click = rotate, mouse wheel = zoom in) or with touch using the controls.

You may also save a screenshot using the "Save" key or with "s".

So, not fully functional yet, but a first demo of what's possible. The most important commands work.
